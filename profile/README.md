OpenPTES is a **community-driven initiative** to develop a **machine-readable data format** for standardizing the complete penetration testing lifecycle. This project aims to address critical gaps in cybersecurity assessment documentation by creating a **comprehensive specification** that captures all phases of penetration testingâ€”from pre-engagement to reportingâ€”while ensuring **interoperability** with existing security standards and tools.

OpenPTES aims to create a **unified specification** that:

1.  **Comprehensively Captures the PTES Lifecycle**: Provides structured data representations for all phases, including pre-engagement, intelligence gathering, threat modeling, vulnerability analysis, exploitation, post-exploitation, and reporting .
2.  **Integrates with Existing Standards**: Acts as an interoperability layer between mature cybersecurity standards rather than replacing them.
3.  **Ensures Evidence Integrity**: Incorporates cryptographic verification and chain of custody tracking for legal admissibility .
4.  **Automates Compliance Mapping**: Directly maps technical findings to regulatory requirements across major frameworks.
5.  **Enables Automation**: Provides machine-readable data structures for seamless integration with security tools and platforms.

## Current Status and Approach

OpenPTES is currently in the **research and design phase**. We are:

- **Analyzing Existing Standards**: Conducting comprehensive analysis of OWASP PTRS, SARIF, OpenVEX, CSAF, and related specifications to identify integration points and gaps .
- **Developing a Hybrid Strategy**: Evaluating architectural approaches (extension vs. orchestration) for combining existing standards rather than creating redundant specifications.
- **Engaging the Community**: Collaborating with penetration testers, security teams, and standards bodies to define requirements and use cases.

## Key Focus Areas

### 1. Standards Integration and Interoperability
- **OWASP PTRS Alignment**: Leveraging the reporting structure while extending coverage to pre-engagement and testing phases.
- **SARIF Compatibility**: Incorporating static and dynamic analysis results using established extensibility patterns.
- **OpenVEX Integration**: Embedding exploitability context and impact assessment within vulnerability findings.
- **Evidence Integrity**: Exploring verifiable credentials and cryptographic hashing for evidence authentication.

### 2. Comprehensive Lifecycle Coverage
- **Pre-Engagement Framework**: Standardizing scoping, rules of engagement, and compliance requirements.
- **Intelligence Gathering**: Structuring OSINT data collection with provenance tracking.
- **Attack Path Representation**: Developing graph-based models for multi-step exploitation sequences.
- **Post-Exploitation Assessment**: Capturing lateral movement and compromise scope analysis.

### 3. Automation and Tool Integration
- **CLI Tools**: Planning development of validation, transformation, and evidence management utilities.
- **Tool Adapters**: Designing integration patterns for popular penetration testing frameworks.
- **Compliance Automation**: Structuring data to enable automated mapping to regulatory requirements.
